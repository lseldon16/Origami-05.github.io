        <h1>Brief History of Origami</h1>
        <!-- This isn't finished-->

        <p>
                The word origami originates from japanes word ori, meaning to fold, and kami, meaning paper.
        </p>
        <p> The origin of origami is unknown. There are debates over whether it comes from Japan or China.
                Paper folding developed in Spain and Europe independent of Japan.
                The reason that it is believed that paper folding in Europe developed independently of Japan is based on
                key differences of the folds. Traditional Japanese folding included cuts and judgement folds to get a
                model to look that way one wanted it. In western origami, the models were more geometric and math based.
                Instead of eyeballing it, it was precise. Japanese origami also depended on paper quality; better models
                came from better paper. Another difference is that Japanese origami was based more around 22.5 degree
                angles and western origami around 45 degree angles.
        </p>
        <p>
                Modern origami has a different drive than traditional origami. Origami models used to be passed down
                through generations orally rather than on paper. This changed in the 1950’s when Yoshizawa Akira
                published a book with new origami models using symbols we still use today. Modern origami is not only
                about the final form of the model but the sequence to get there and the replicability of the model.
                There is a focus on origami as a puzzle where there wasn’t before.
