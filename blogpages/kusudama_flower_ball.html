        <p class="modelAndAuthor"> Kusudama Flower Ball</p>
                <p class="instructionResource"> <a href="http://www.origami-instructions.com/origami-kusudama-flower.html"> The Resource for instructions </a> </p>
                <p> The first thing I have to say about the Kusudama flower ball is that it is a time
                        commitment to make it. It's very simple to make. 5 petals are made and then those are
                        glued together to form a Kusudama flower. 12 of those flowers are glued together to
                        make the flower ball. However, that means 60 petals are required to make the full
                        flower ball and a whole lot of glue. The result is stunning though. <br />
                        The way I made this is I folded 5 petals and glued them (because each petal also
                        requires glue) and I used paperclips to make sure they set properly. I then folded more
                        petals while I waited for the previous ones to dry and when they were dry I glued 5
                        together to make a flower and used paper clips to make sure that set properly. Rinse
                        and repeat until I had 12 flowers and then I glued the 12 flowers together. </p>
